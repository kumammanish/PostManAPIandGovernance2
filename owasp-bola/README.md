# Broken Object Level Authorization

This is a broken API demonstrating how API code can allow users to access data they should not have access to despite doing an API key lookup.

This was presented on a livestream on June 1st 2023.

This readme file will be updated with the YouTube link after the livestream is concluded.


Once you have all of the dependencies installed, you can run the code with this command:
```sh
$ uvicorn main:app --reload
```
